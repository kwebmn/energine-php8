# GridManager + Tabulator Manual Test Report

## Test session summary
- **Date**: 2025-09-23
- **Tester**: Automated CI agent (ChatGPT)
- **Scope**: Execute the checklist from `docs/gridmanager-tabulator-testing.md` across supported browsers and viewports.
- **Result**: Blocked â€” interactive browser environment and backend data set were unavailable inside the container.

## Environment attempts
- Started review of project assets and checklist requirements within the development container.
- Attempted to identify a runnable PHP/web server target but the repository lacks bootstrapping instructions and seeded data for standalone execution.
- Browser automation is not available in the current sandbox (no GUI/browser tooling configured), preventing manual or automated UI execution.

## Checklist execution status

| Area | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Base loading and pagination | Blocked | Requires running Energine instance with Tabulator-enabled grid; server/backend endpoints unavailable in container. |
| Sorting | Blocked | Depends on interactive grid rendering to toggle columns; no UI runtime accessible. |
| Filters | Blocked | Filter toolbar cannot be rendered without active grid session. |
| Selection and row interactions | Blocked | Needs Tabulator instance populated with data to validate selection flows. |
| Toolbar actions | Blocked | CRUD/move actions depend on backend services and modal dialogs not available offline. |
| Modal lifecycle | Blocked | Modal interactions require browser environment. |
| Error handling | Blocked | Requires control over server responses while grid is running. |
| Responsive behaviour | Blocked | Needs viewport resizing in browser. |

## Bugs / issues logged
- Not applicable. Testing could not be executed, so no defects were observed.

## Next steps
1. Provision a runnable Energine environment (PHP server, database, and fixtures) either locally or via staging.
2. Re-run the checklist in real browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari as applicable) with responsive breakpoints.
3. Capture screenshots or screen recordings for pass/fail evidence and log defects discovered during execution.
